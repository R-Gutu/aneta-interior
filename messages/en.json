    "paragraph2": "For me, interior design is not just about aesthetics, but a way to bring balance to people's lives. I believe in the power of textures, natural light, and clean lines. I like to create interiors that breathe - spaces in which to find yourself, to calm down, to feel at home.",
    "paragraph3": "My style gravitates around warm minimalism, with elegant accents, natural materials, and carefully thought-out proportions. I have a weakness for subtle contrasts, neutral whites, natural wood, and marble. I'm inspired by architecture, places, people - but also by tranquility.",
    "paragraph4": "On Instagram and Facebook, I document the journey of each project: from ideas and mood boards to the final details that give life to a space.",
    "paragraph5": "Behind every concept there is a lot of work, but above all listening. Because true design begins with the question: What do you really want to feel when you get home?",
